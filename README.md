## About

NovaLabs is built to handle the full operational lifecycle of a modern coworking space — from member onboarding to daily attendance tracking, workspace booking, invoicing, and administrative oversight.

The platform is **modular**, **scalable**, and designed with enterprise-grade real-world needs in mind. Whether you're running a single coworking floor or a network of tech hubs across multiple cities, NovaLabs grows with you.

| 📊 **Analytics & Attendance Logs** | Rich dashboards with attendance history and activity reports |
| 🧾 **Invoicing & Payments** | Automated invoice generation and payment notifications |
| 📧 **Smart Email Notifications** | Branded transactional emails for bookings, payments, and alerts |
| 🔒 **2FA & OTP Security** | Two-factor authentication and OTP verification flows |

---

## Tech Stack

NovaLabs uses a modern, production-grade full-stack technology stack:

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| **Frontend** | Next.js 14, React, Tailwind CSS |
| **Backend** | NestJS, Node.js |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL |
| **Auth** | JWT, TOTP (2FA), Biometric |
| **Blockchain / Contracts** | Rust, Stellar |
| **Email** | Transactional email templates (HTML) |
| **Deployment** | Vercel (Frontend), Node server (Backend) |
| **CI/CD** | GitHub Actions |

> **Why NestJS + Next.js?** NestJS handles complex business logic, auth flows, and multi-client API needs with a structured, maintainable architecture — something Next.js API routes alone aren't optimized for at scale. This combination gives NovaLabs both a great developer experience and a solid production foundation.
